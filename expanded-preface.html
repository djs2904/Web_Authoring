        <h1>Expanded Preface</h1>

        <section class="preface-content">
            <p>Welcome to a week in my life, where I document the waste I discard. This project, "<strong>Trash of the Week</strong>" (TWP), goes beyond the physical act of throwing things away. It’s an introspective journey exploring what my waste reveals about me—my consumption habits, personal values, and the societal influences that shape my decisions.</p>

            <p>As Sarah Newman suggests, garbage is more than just discarded material; it tells a story. She argues that every piece of trash carries cultural and personal significance, offering insights into human behavior. Inspired by this idea, TWP isn’t just about cataloging my waste—it’s about interpreting its meaning.</p>

            <h2>Understanding My Consumption</h2>
            <p>This project prompts me to ask: <em>Why do I throw things away?</em> Was the purchase necessary, or was it an impulse driven by marketing? Did I discard something because it was genuinely unusable, or simply out of convenience? Are my choices shaped by societal trends I’m not even aware of?</p>

            <p>Brian Thill, in his book <em>Waste</em>, describes our discarded items as a "material autobiography"—a tangible record of our habits and priorities. While we may claim to care about sustainability, our trash often tells a different story. My project aims to confront this contradiction and examine the gap between my environmental ideals and actual practices.</p>

            <h2>Influences & Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Eduardo Muniz's <em>Lixo Extraordinário</em> (Waste Land) highlights how trash can offer a window into social realities. Even the most marginalized communities leave behind artifacts that tell stories of their lives. On a personal level, my project serves as a similar exploration—an archaeology of my daily existence.</p>

            <p>This work also aligns with Dr. Jenna Jambeck’s research on plastic waste and its global impact. While her studies examine large-scale environmental effects, TWP focuses on the micro-level—how individual choices contribute to broader waste patterns.</p>

            <h2>Is This Art, Activism, or Self-Reflection?</h2>
            <p>TWP is primarily a self-reflective project. It is not an activist initiative, but it naturally intersects with environmental awareness. It has elements of art, as it creatively reframes an overlooked part of daily life—trash—as something meaningful. It also functions as a personal journal, documenting my decisions and their consequences.</p>

            <h2>What This Project Means</h2>
            <p>Inspired by initiatives like <em>The Dumpster Project</em>, which examines waste from a scientific perspective, my project takes a more personal approach. While they analyze waste at a macro level, I explore the micro level—what my individual choices reveal about me.</p>

            <p>By examining my own consumption, I hope to better understand the hidden narratives within my waste and, ultimately, make more conscious decisions in the future.</p>
